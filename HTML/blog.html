            I have always been really very passionate about  <br>
            dance and I'm actually good at it. Since a very  <br>
            young age, I have liked dressing up and dacning my <br>
            heart out. My mom tells me, when I was around 3/4 <br>
            years old, I would put on my favourite ghaghra <br>
            and dance my heart out on my favourite song at <br>
            that time 'Kajra re'.

                    That's when my dance journey began. Seeing my love for dancing
                    my mom made my join Kathak classes. I fell in love with this dance form
                    almost immediately. I have been practicing Kathak since the age of 8
                    and still am a huge fan of it. These classes became my favourite part of the
                    week. I did several competitions and stageshows with my guru who I am forever
                    thankful to. She made me the dancer I am today. I will always owe that to her.
                    She pushed me when I was down because she saw the potential in me. Because of this
                    classical dance, the basics of dancing became really strong for me which is why
                    now, I can do any form of dance very easily. <br> <br>
                    Now whenever I listen to music, I easily make up dances up in my head and if
                    someone tells me to dance to a song I know on the spot, I'll be able to do it
                    easily. In dj parties, I am the only who knows all the hooksteps to every song
                    played. I can also learn choregraphies by just looking at them for 10-15 times.
                    My favourite way to past time is by learning new dances from youtube everyday, or 
                    just by closing the curtains, locking myslef in a room, putting out loud music
                    and dancing my heart out. Thats theraputic for me. I will never stop dancing!

            Another one of my passions is Food. I love trying new cuisines, foods,
            and restaurants. My favourite food changes every month for eg,
            right now my favourite cuisine is Pan-asian. Sushi, ramen, kimchi
            etc are all foods I've never tried before, which I love now.
            Even though my favourite foods cange every month, there are two foods 
            I love eating and would never stop loving whicb is Dal chawaal and maggi.
            These two are my comfort foods. I would never these two with anything 
            in the world. In fact, I love maggi so much, that my friends once gifted
            me 15 packets of maggi for my birthday!  <br> <br>

<h4 class="fontf ta ts2 bgcol3 tcol1"> Hobbies </h4> <br> <br>
<h6 class="fontf ta ts2 border border-2 border-dark p-4">
    I have a lot of hobbies one of which I have turned into my career which is drawing
    and creativity. Just like I've always loved dancing, I've loved drawing too. 
    After my 10th got over, I knew I wanted to do something in the creative field and not just
    science, commerce or arts. Other hobbies include Watching movies, especially 
    tru crime documentries, thrillers, suspense and action movies or series. My current favourite
    show has to be Manifest on netfilx and stranger things too. Are just being at the theater
    or at an airport makes me happy. I love flights! Sketching, drawing and painting have become a 
    a part of my daily life now too. I love playing board games and having games nights with
    friends or family; which way I get to spend quality time with my family too which makes me 
    very happy. Listening to music, like everyone is one of my favourite hobbies. I had a phase
    when I loved the band called BTS. They had become my life and I was crazy behind them. I still 
    listen to their songs but dont follow them as religiously as I used to. I have infact made
    friends because I connected with other bts fans. My ideal hangout session with my friends would be
    sitting at home, playing board games, watching movies, eating together, gossiping, dancing our 
    hearts out and just having a chill vibe, instead of going out or clubbing.
